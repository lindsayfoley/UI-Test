UI-Test
=======

Welcome to the Easyroommate.com UI test.

  Please follow the below instructions:
  
  1) Attached is a PNG of a page we’ve recently developed but isn’t live yet 
  
  2) Ideally, it would be great to see how far you get on this in 4hrs (max) 
  
  3) Think interactive and responsive – we try to make these UI designs come to life in code.
  
  4) Use HTML5, CSS3 and JS/jQuery. Ideally SASS too… but don’t worry if not. I’d rather see how you approach it using something you’re comfortable with. 
  
  5) We’ll be looking at your general approach, accuracy (we do understand that we aren’t giving you a layered PSD here), CSS techniques, JS/jquery skills and quality of HTML (especially for SEO purposes) 
  
  6) Don’t worry about the pictures or actual data – just fake it or use anything you have
  
  7) Our font is Lato and is available free of charge from Google Fonts.
