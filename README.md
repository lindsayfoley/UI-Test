UI-Test
==============
Welcome to the Easyroommate.com UI test.

In this Git repository, we have a PNG of a page we've recently developed but is not live yet.

What we want you to do is translate the layout to code.  We expect you to spend around 4 hours to see how far you can get with your implementation.

####What we are looking for:
* Think interactive and responsive – we try to make these UI designs come to life in code.
* Use HTML5, CSS3 and JS/jQuery. Ideally SASS too… but don’t worry if not. I’d rather see how you approach it using something you’re comfortable with. 
* We’ll be looking at your general approach, accuracy (we do understand that we aren’t giving you a layered PSD here), CSS techniques, JS/jquery skills and quality of HTML (especially for SEO purposes) 
* Don’t worry about the pictures or actual data – just fake it or use anything you have
* Our font is Lato and is available free of charge from Google Fonts.

####How to send this to us
* We would like you to upload all of your code and assets to the repository that we created for you.
* Once you have done this, please email the recruitment agent who will then notify us.
